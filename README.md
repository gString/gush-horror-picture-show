Notes:

* Didnâ€™t care much for the way Fox site handle the textual navigation bar in small resolutions, so I did my own simplified one. It could use a little polish, though.

* No unit tests or prop-types, for brevity sake

* No image-loading handling

* Tested on Mac: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari
on PC: Chrome, Edge
